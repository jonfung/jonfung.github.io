Hey, been shooting you emails from markus@tplus.cx - but I wasn't getting a response so I figured this might be more effective

Anyway, i'm working on an intent presettlement protocol called tplus ([tplux.cx](https://tplus.cx/)) - basically trying to actually push financial markets forward by using crypto rails and decoupling confirmations from withdrawals

We're offering:

- offchain continuous private orderbook running in a TEE
- access to all chains/protocols as settlement venues which means we can support any financial interaction - spot, loans, perps, options, you can do it all
- optimal settlement enviroment for market makers (batched&partial settlement utilizing any liquidity on a super flexible timeframe)
- optimal quoting enviroment for MMs and users
- and ofc, a noncustodial, decentralized transacting venue

Started it because I've been building DeFi for a while and have become frustrated at how bad we are at making the excellent execution enviroments we've created actually competitive with tradfi orderflow execution. Trying to tie all of defi into an approachable, highly efficient, decentralized and private product that can outcompete all the CEX and OTC stuff, before eventually outcompeting tradfi venues.

I think you're background makes you a really good fit, and even if you're not interested in working on it I'd love to get your take on the product.

Please shoot me an email at markus@tplus.cx
