		<h2>Pinterest GREP</h2>Pinterest Hackathon 2019. Productionized internal forks of open source projects <a href="https://github.com/livegrep/livegrep" class = "inline">Livegrep</a> and <a href="https://github.com/LINKIWI/webgrep" class = "inline">Webgrep</a> to provide real-time source code search across all source repositories with double-digit millisecond median query latency.
		Fully integrated with Pinterest internal services. Implemented as a scalable, fault-tolerant service mesh with load balancing, internal auth, and multi-zone redundancy. </br></br>
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RB2l9mK-bv4" class = "inline">EE123 Digital Signal Processing Final Project</a>. The objective of the project was to send a highest possible quality photo through a 2.5KHz wide wireless channel (Baofeng Ham Radios) in 75 seconds. We implemented our own modems and compression algorithms on Raspberry Pis. Used custom AFSK2400 modems, JPEG compression, vector quantization. <a href="./assets/psnr.png">Sample Image and PSNR.</a> <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee123/sp18/project.html">Project Spec.</a></br></br>
		<a href="https://headphone-recommender.herokuapp.com/" class = "inline">mp3-fft</a> Webapp that takes in a mp3 song and recommends 100+ headphones based on price, form factor, and sound signature (bassy, neutral, mid, v-shaped). Uses the Fourier Transform and Welch's method on the mp3 to generate a spectral density estimation of the song, then classifies it and returns a list of headphones for the user.</br></br>
